# Regression

Dependent Variable | Output | Predictions | (Y) : Continuous Data Type

Independent Variable | Predictors | (X) : Continuous | Nominal | Categorical

Regression tries to Find Best Fit Line which Shows Relationship between the Dependent Variable and Independent Variable with Least Error.

y = mx + c + e

Coefficient of Independent Variable is Slope
c is y Intercept
e : Error

MAE : Mean Absolute Error
      Average Absolute Difference between the Actual and Prediction

RSS : Residual Sum of Squares 
      Difference between the Expected and Actual
