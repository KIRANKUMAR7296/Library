# Object Oriented Programming

Structuring a Program by Bundling related **Properties** | **Attributes** and **Behaviors** into Individual **Objects**.

### Procedural Programming
- Structures a Program like a Recipe in that it provides a Set of Steps, in the form of **Functions** and **Code Blocks**, that flow Sequentially in order to complete task.
- 
### Class
- A **Blueprint** for **Creating** an **Object**
- For **Instance**, an object could represent a person with **Properties** like a Name, Age and Address and **Behaviours** such as **Walking**, **Talking** and **Running**.
- An Object could represent an email with **Properties** like **Recipient**, **Subject** and **Body** and **Behaviours** like **Adding Attachments** and **Sending Data**.
- Create **User Defined** Data Structures
- Defines **Functions** called as **Methods** (Identifies the Behaviors and Actions than an **Object** created from  the Class can perform with its Data.

**Define a Class** 
``` Python
class Student:
    pass
```
