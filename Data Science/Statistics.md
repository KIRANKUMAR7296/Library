# Mean Deviation  

- Average of all Values from the Mean

> sum(x - x.mean()) / n

### Steps to Calculate :
1. Find Mean.
2. Find Distance of Each Value from that Mean.
3. Find Mean of those Distances.

# Absolute Deviation
- || ignores Negative Value.

# Standard Deviation
- Measure of How Spread out Numbers are.

# Variance
- The Average of the Squared Differences from the Mean.

> N : Number of Data

> for Population : N

> for Sample : N-1

# Comparing Data 

> Univariate : One Variable (One Type of Data)

> Bivariate : Two Variables (Two Type of Data)

# Correlation 
- Relationship between two Variables

> Correlation is Positive when the Values increase together.

> Correlation is Negative when One Decreases and other Increases.

### Values can have a Value between 1 to -1
> 1 : Perfect Positive Correlation

> 0 : No Correlation

> -1 : Perfect Negative Correlation

> Close to 0 : Weak Correlation.

> Close to 1 : Strong Correlation.
