# Ensemble Techniques

> Combining Multiple Models.

### A. Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregation)

- Dataset is divided and passed as sample of Datasets to **Multiple Base Learners**.
- Dataset is passed with **Row Sampling** with **Replacement** (**Bootstrap**)
- Each Learning Model will be trained on its particular sample of Data.
- Voting Classifier is used to find the Final Result (**Aggregation**)
