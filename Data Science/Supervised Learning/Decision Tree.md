- **Upside Down** Approach
- Top Node ( **Root** ) | Decisions ( **Nodes** ) | Splits of Trees ( **Edges** | **Branches** ) | Terminal Node ( **Leaf** )
- Growing a **Tree** involves deciding on **Which Features to Choose ?** and **What Conditions to Use ?** for splitting.
- We should also know when to **Stop**
- **Pruning** : Removing **Features** that are not important.

 Continuous can be Converted into **Binary** or **Boolean** by Setting **Threshold**.
- Set the Value to **False** or **0** if it is less than the **Median**.
- Set the Value to **True** or **1** if it is greater than the **Median**.
