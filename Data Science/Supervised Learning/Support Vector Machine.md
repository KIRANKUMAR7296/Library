# Support Vector Machine | SVM

SVM can be used for both **Regression** and **Classification**

- The Algorithm finds a **Line** or **Hyperplane** that Separates the 2 Classes with Maximum **Margin**.

- **Hyperplanes** are Decision Boundaries that help Classify the Data Points.

- Data Points are **Support Vectors**.

- SVM can be used for Linear and Non Linear Data.

- SVM can be used as Kernel Trick for Non Linear Data which Creates a **Hyperplane** in N Dimensional Space.

### Benefits 

- SVM also works well with Unstructured and Semi Structured Data ( Text, Image, Tree )
- Generalize Well ( Works well on New Unseen Data )
- Risk of **Overfitting** is Less.

### Disadvantage

- Choosing a Good Kernel Function is not easy
- Long **Training Time** for Large Datasets.
- Difficult to Interpret and Understand Final Model, Variable Weights and Individual Impact.
- Not easy to Fine Tune and Visualize.
