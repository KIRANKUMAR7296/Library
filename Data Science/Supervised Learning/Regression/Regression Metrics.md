# Regression Metrics

1. We Start by some Initial Configuration of Model and `Predict` the **Output** based on some **Input**.
2. Predicted Value is compared with the `Target` and Measure the `Performance` of our Model.
3. Various Parameters of the Model are `Adjusted Iteratively` in order to reach the **Optimal Value** of the **Performance Metric**.
