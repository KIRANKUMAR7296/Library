# Model Training 

### How to Train Machine Learning Model

- Separate Training and Test Subsets of Datasets

Training Set - Fit | Train and Tune Model with Training Data

Test Set - Unseen Data 

Parameters | Hyperparameters
:--- | :---
**Estimated** from Data Automatically | `Adjusted` Manually for **Optimal** Performance 

### Cross Validation
- Training Subsets of Dataset to get Assurance of out Prediction and Accuracy.

### Performance Metrics 
- Regression : MAE | MSE | RMSE | R<sup>2</sup>
- Classification : Classification Report | Confusion Matrix | Accuracy Score | ROC AUC Curve

**Performace** should be Consistent on every Cross Validated Samples.
