# Model Training 

### How to Train Machine Learning Model

- Separate Training and Test Subsets of Datasets

Training Set - Fit | Train and Tune Model with Training Data

Test Set - Unseen Data 

Parameters | Hyperparameters
:--- | :---
**Estimated** from Data Automatically | `Adjusted` Manually for **Optimal** Performance 

### Cross Validation
- Training Subsets of Dataset to get Assurance of out Prediction and Accuracy.

### Performance Metrics 
Regression | Classification 
:--- | :---
MAE, MSE, RMSE and R<sup>2</sup> | Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Score and ROC AUC Curve

> **Performace** should be Consistent on every Samples.
