# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyze and Investigate Data Sets and Summarize | Describe Main Characteristics of Data 
- Includes Data Visualization Methods.
- Discover Patterns | Spot Anomalies | Detect Outlier | Test Hypothesis | Check Assumptions
- Better Understanding of Data Set (Variables | Features | Relationships | Patterns)
- Sophisticated Data Analysis 

### Tools
- Clustering and Dimension Reduction 
- Univariate (Just One Variable) Describe the Data and Find Pattern within. 
- Steam and Leaf Plot(Shape of Distribution) | Histogram (Frequency of Data) | Bar Plot(Frequency of Data) | Box Plot (Median, Min, Max, Quantiles) Visualize Univariate Data.
- Bivariate | Multivariate Visualization to Understand Relationships 
- K Mean CLustering (Unsupervised Learning)

### Steps
1. Importing Data Set
2. Identify Number of Features and Columns 
3. Identify Data Types, Number of Observations
4. Check for Missing Data | Identify Missing Data 
5. Explore Categorical Features
