# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyze and Investigate Data Sets and Summarize | Describe Main Characteristics of Data 
- Includes Data Visualization Methods.
- Discover Patterns | Spot Anomalies | Detect Outlier | Test Hypothesis | Check Assumptions
- Better Understanding of Data Set (Variables | Features | Relationships | Patterns)
- Sophisticated Data Analysis 

### Tools
- Clustering and Dimension Reduction 
- K Mean CLustering (Unsupervised Learning)

### Univariate (Just One Variable) 
- Describe the Data and Find Pattern within by Visualizing Univariate Data.
- Steam and Leaf Plot(Shape of Distribution)  
- Histogram (Frequency of Data) 
- Bar Plot(Frequency of Data)  
- Box Plot (Median, Min, Max, Quantiles) 

### Multivariate  
- Understand Relationships
- Grouped Bar Plots (Each Bar Represents One Variable)
- Scatter Plot (Plot Data Points on a Horizontal and Vertical Axis | Show How much One Variable is Affected by another)
- Line Graph
- Bubble Charts 
- Heat Map (Data Values are Represented by Intensity of Colours in Grid)


### Steps
1. Importing Data Set
2. Identify Number of Features and Columns 
3. Identify Data Types, Number of Observations
4. Check for Missing Data | Identify Missing Data 
5. Explore Categorical Features
