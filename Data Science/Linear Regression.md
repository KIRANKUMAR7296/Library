# Linear Regression

**Learning** a Linear Regression Model means Estimating the Values of the **Coefficient** (Slope, Intercept, Bias)

#### Simple Linear Regression
- Single Input | Independent Feature 
- Use Statistics to Estimate Coefficients
- Mean | Median | Standard Deviations | Correlation and Covariance

#### Ordinary Least Squares
- More than One Independent Features
- Minimize the Sum of Squared Residuals | Errors 
- Sum(Square(Distance between the Actual Data Point and the Predicted Point (Regression Line)))
- Treat Data as Matrix
- Use Linear Algebra to Estimate | Predict the Optimal Value for the Coefficients.
