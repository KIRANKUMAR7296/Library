# How to Deal with Missing Data

### 1. Deletion
- Remove all Data | Observations that has one or **Missing Values**.
- If Missing Data is limited to Small number of **Observations**, eliminate those cases from the **Analysis**.

> But it is always Better to Keep Data than to **Discard** it.

### 2. Imputation
- Continuous : Mean | Median | Mode | Multiple Imputation
- Categorical : Treat **NA** as a Category | Multiple Imputation
