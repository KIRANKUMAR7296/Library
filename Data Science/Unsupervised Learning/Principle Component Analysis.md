# Principle Component Analysis | PCA

**Unsupervised** Machine Learning Algorithm.

**Dimensionally** Reduction Algorithm.

One of the easiest and most intuitive ways to reduce the number of **Dimensions** | **Attributes** | **Features** of a Dataset.

Identifying the **Hyperplane** closest to the Dataset

Main Aim is to reduce **Overfitting**, try to reduce the **Complexity** of the Model.

The Model gets confused if very large number of **Features** are passed at the Time of **Training**.

PCA Converts the **Highly Correlated Data** into **Clusters**.
