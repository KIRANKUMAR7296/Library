# Principle Component Analysis | PCA

- **Unsupervised** Machine Learning Algorithm.

- **Dimensionally** Reduction Algorithm.

- Identify **Correlations** and **Patterns** in a **Data Set** so that it can be **Transformed** into a **Low Dimension Data Set**. 

- Dimensions are reduced without any Loss of **Important Information**.

- Remove **Inconsistencies**, **Redundant** and **Highly Correlated** Data.

- One of the easiest and most intuitive ways to reduce the number of **Dimensions** | **Attributes** | **Features** of a Dataset.

- Reducing Dimension is a part of **Data Preprocessing**.

- Identifying the **Hyperplane** closest to the Dataset

- Main Aim is to reduce **Overfitting**, try to reduce the **Complexity** of the Model.

- The Model gets confused if very large number of **Features** are passed at the Time of **Training**.

- PCA Converts the **Highly Correlated Data** into **Clusters**.

- The Increasing Number of Dimenisons is a **Curse**, it decreases the **Accuracy** of Model.

- Never Select Feature which Creates lot of **Variance**.

- The **Curse of Dimensionality** increases with the Increase in the number of **Dimensions**.

-  It is said that Model is trained well with large the amount of data, but records (Rows) should be more not features.
