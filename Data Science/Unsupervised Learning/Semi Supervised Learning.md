# Semi Supervised Learning

- Combination of a Small Amount of **Labeled Data** and a Large Amount of **Unlabeled Data** to **Train** the Model.
- Combination of **Labeled Training Data** and **Unlabeled Training Data**.
- Supervised Learning Models are Trained with **Labeled Datasets**.
- The Reason Labeled Data is used is so that when the Algorithm predicts the Label,
- The Difference between the **Prediction** and **Label** can be calculated and then minimized for **Accuracy**.

- Unsupervised Models Learn to Identify **Patterns** and **Trends** or **Categorize** Data without Labeling it.

### There is More Unsupervised Learning Data available in the World

### How to Train?
- Train the Model with the **Small Amount** of **Labeled Training Data** until it gives a Good Result.
- Then Use it with **Unlabeld Training Dataset** to **Predict** ( They may not be **Accurate** )
- Link the **Labeled Training Data** to **Unlabeled Training Data**, Train the Model 
- Decrease the **Error**
- Improve the Model's Accuracy

### Example
- Text Document Classifier
