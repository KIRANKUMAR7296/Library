# Unspervised Machine Learning

### How Unsupervised Machine Learning Works

### Step 1
- Provide the **Machine Learning Algorithm** Uncategorized, Unlabeled Input Data to see what **Patterns** it finds.

### Step 2
- **Observe** and **Learn** from **Patterns** the Machine Identifies.

### Type of Problems to which it's suited

1. **Clustering**
- Identifying **Similarities** in **Groups**

2. **Anomaly Detection**
- Identifying **Abnormalities** in Data
