# Clustering Analysis

- Dividing the Population or Data points into number of Groups | Segments | Clusters such that Similar Data Points belongs to Same Group.

### Types 

1. Hard Clustering 
- Each Data Point belongs to only one Group. 
- No Overlap, No Sharing with the Data Points of Different Groups.

2. Soft Clustering
- Probability of Data Point to be in Cluster is Assigned.

### Type of Clustering Algorithm

1. Connectivity Models
- Data points closer in Data Space exhibit more similarity to each other that the Data Points lying Far away.

2. Centroid Models 
- K Mean Clustering
- Iterative Clustering Algorithm
- Closeness of Data Points to the Centroid of the Clusters.

3. Distribution Models
- All Data Points in the Cluster belong to the Same Distribution
- e.g. Grade Distribution of Class ( Few are just Passed, Few have Scored Very Good and more are Average centered around Mean | Median )

4. Density Models
- Density of Data Points in Data Space
- DBSCAN

### Application of Clustering
1. Recommendation Engines
2. Market Segmentation ( Geographic | Demographic | Psycographic | Behavioural )
3. Social Network Analysis ( Actor, Food, travel, Love, Automobile, Decor )
4. Medical Imaging ( Images of various parts of Body for **Diagnosis** and **Treatment** )
5. Image Segmentation ( Partioning Image into Multiplt Segments )
6. Anomaly Detection ( Outlier Analysis )
