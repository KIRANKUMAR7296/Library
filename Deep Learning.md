# Deep Learning

### Multi Layer Perceptron ( Core Component of Deep Learning )

- Classic Feed Forward Artificial Neural Network 
- Connected Series of Node ( Directed Acyclic Graph ) No Node is Revisited 
- Each Node Represents a **Function** or a **Model**

### When to Use ?

- **Categorical** or **Continuous** Target Variable
- Very Complex Relationships in Data
- When Control over Training is very Important ( Lot of Hyperparameters is to be Tuned )

### Not to Use 

- Image Recognition 
- Time Series
