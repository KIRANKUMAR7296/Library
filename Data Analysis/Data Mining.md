# Data Mining

### 3 V : Volume, Velocity and Variety of Data

Having a Lot of **Observation** ( **Rows** ) is a Good Thing but things get much Complicated when you have many **Dimensions**, **Features** or **Variables**

### Risk of **Overfitting**

Combine Variable to Reduce Error | Complexity which results in more Stable Model and **Generalization**

### Phases of Data Mining

### CRISP - DM ( Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining )

### 1. Business Understanding
- Determine Objective of Business
- Determine Goals of Data Mining
- Produce Project Plans

### 2. Data Understanding
- Collect Initial Data
- Describe Data
- Explore Data ( EDA ) 
- Verify **Quality** of Data 

### 3. Data Preparation
- Describe the Data Set
- Select Proper Data
- Clean Data
- Construct Data ( Derive New Attributes )
- Integrate Data
- Format the Data

### 4. Data Modeling
- Select Modeling Technique
- Generate Test Design
- Build the Model
- Train the Model

### 5. Data Evaluation
- Evaluate the Results
- Review the Process
- Improve the Model
- Make Final Decision

### 6. Deployment
- Plan Deployment
- Plan Monitoring and Maintenance
- Produce Final Report
- Review the Project
- Documentation of Project

### Important Points to Validate Results

1. Check the Data ( **Distribution** of Data , Check for **Outliers**, Anolmalies in Data  )
2. Check the Fit ( How Well the Data Fits the Model )
3. Check the Sample ( **Sample** should Represent **Population** )

### Hold Out Validation
- Split the Data into Train Set and Test Set
- Train Model on Test Set  ( Data Mining is Done on Train Set )
- Test Model on Test Set

### Cross Validation
- Split Data Set into K Folds
- Train Model on K - 1 
- Test Moden on K
- Repeat K Times

### Dimensionality Reduction 
- Project Data into Lower Dimension while Preserving as much as Useful Variability ( 19/20 ) as Possible
- e.g If we Observe a Scatter Plot in Multidimesion it will be Complicated to Understand 
- but if we Consider only 1 Dimension then It is just a Line and few Points in which some are close to Line and some are bit far away from line.
