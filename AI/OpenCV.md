# Open Computer Vision

- Computers Gain High Level Understanding from Digital Images or Videos.
- Works on Pattern Recognition.
- Understand and Automate the Task of Human Visual System.
- Detecting and Image | Object Labeling has Surpassed Humans.
- Faster than Human Reaction and 99% Accuracy
- High Amount of Visual Data (Images and Videos) with Processing Capabilities.

### Image Processing
- **Extract Infromation** from Image 
- **Enhance** the Image

### Pixel
- Basic **Fundamental Unit** of Image 
- Multiple Pixels arranged in **Rows** and **Columns** forms an **Image**
- Binary, Black and White, Grayscale, RGB Color Image

> Black and White and Greyscale Images are **Different**
- Black and White is only Composed with Black or White
- Grayscale is combination of Different Grades of Black and White.

### Applications
