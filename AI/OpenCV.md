# Open Computer Vision

- Computers Gain High Level Understanding from Digital Images or Videos.
- Works on Pattern Recognition.
- Understand and Automate the Task of Human Visual System.
- Detecting and Image | Object Labeling has Surpassed Humans.
- Faster than Human Reaction and 99% Accuracy
- High Amount of Visual Data (Images and Videos) with Processing Capabilities.

### Image Processing
- **Extract Infromation** from Image 
- **Enhance** the Image

### Pixel
- Basic **Fundamental Unit** of Image 
- Multiple Pixels arranged in **Rows** and **Columns** forms an **Image**
- Binary, Black and White, Grayscale, RGB Color Image

> Black and White and Greyscale Images are **Different**
- Black and White is only Composed with Black or White
- Grayscale is combination of Different Grades of Black and White.

### **Binary** need `1 Bit Per Pixel` for Storage and **Black** and **White** needs `8 Bits Per Pixel` for **Storage**.
- Black and White will be **Dense** and shall render **Better Quality**.

### Applications 
1. Self Driving Cars
2. Facial Recognition
3. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality
4. Health Care ( X Ray and MRI Scan )
5. Video Motion Analysis 
6. Image Segmentation ( Camera Detects the Multiple Faces in a Group Selfie )
7. Scene Reconstruction ( 3D Model Creation in Architecture )
8. Image Restoration ( Filtering Blur Images and Removing Noise )
