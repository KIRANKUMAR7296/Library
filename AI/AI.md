# AI | Artificial Intelligence
- Computers Perform the Task that Normally requires Human Intelligence.
- Mimic the Intelligence or Behavioural Patterns of Humans.
- Ability to Learn and Reason like Humans.

# ML | Machine Learning
- Computers Learn from Data and Act like Humans.
- Computers Learn without being Explicitly Programmed.
- Find Patterns and Relationship between Features and Labels.
- Improve Automatically through Experience.
- A Set of Algorithms that Allows Computers to Learn from Data without being Explicitly Programmed.

Types :
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Semisupervised Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning

# DL | Deep Learning
- Perform ML Inspired by Human Brain Networks of Neurons.
- Artificial Neural Networks Adapt and Learn from Vast Amounts of Data.

# Neural Network
- Finding Patterns and Relationships between Data like Human Brains.

# NLP | Natural Language Processing
- Branch of AI
- Computer Learn | Gain | Understand from Human Languages.
- Interaction between Computers and Humans using the Natural Language.
- Objective of NLP is to Read, Interpret, Understand and Make Sense of the Human Languages.
- NLP rely on ML to Derive Meaning from Human Lanuages.

Process :
1. Human Talk to Machine. 
2. Machine Capture Audio.
3. Convert Audio to Text.
4. Process Text Data (Interpret > Convert)
5. Convert Data to Audio.
6. Machine Talk | Reply to Human.

Applications :
1. Google Translate 
2. Word Processor | Grammer Check in Microsoft Word.
3. IVR | Interactive Voice Response in Call Centers.
4. Voice Assistant : OK Google, Siri, Cortana and Alexa.

# Computer Vision
- Computers Gain High Level Understanding from Digital Images or Videos.
- Works on Pattern Recognition.
- Understand and Automate the Task of Human Visual System.
- Detecting and Image | Object Labeling has Surpassed Humans.
- Faster than Human Reaction and 99% Accuracy
- High Amount of Visual Data (Images and Videos) with Processing Capabilities.

Applications :
1. Self Driving Cars
2. Facial Recognition
3. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality
4. Health Care (X Ray and MRI Scan)
5. Video Motion Analysis 
6. Image Segmentation (Camera Detects the Multiple Faces in a Group Selfie)
7. Scene Reconstruction (3D Model Creation in Architecture)
8. Image Restoration (Filtering Blur Images and Removing Noise)

Task :
1. Object Classification : Image consist a Cat
2. Object Detection: Classification + Localization : Multiple Objects can be Detected in the Image (Dog | Cat | Rat)
3. Object Identification : Type of Object in an Image
4. Instant Segmentation : Extract the Images from its Edges | Boundaries.

# IoT | Internet of Things 
- Connecting Everything in the World to the Internet
- Gives Ability to Send and Receive Information.
- Sea of Data
- Extending Power of Internet beyond Computers and Smartphones to a Whole Range of other Things in the Environments.
- A System of Interrelated Computing Devices, Mechaniacal Devices and Digital Machines | Gadgets.
- Every Machine, Device, Object, Animal and Person is Provided with Unique Identifier.
- Ability to Transfer Data over a Network without Human to Human or Human to Machine Interaction. 
- Integrate and Control Everything in the House using Device.

Simple Examples :
1. Search : We can Search | Upload | Download  Any Data, Image, Song, Documents, Audio Stored at one Place from Anywhere in this World.
2. Wearables : Fitness Bands | Smart Watches Measures Human Health and Captures Behavioural Patterns and Transfer Data to Database.
3. Health : Wearables consisting of Sensors Monitor Humans Health Patterns and Alert on some Vital Sign | Risk Situation.
4. Traffic Monitoring : Traffics are Visible on Maps, Fastest Route or Alternate Routes.
5. Fleet Management : Connect Fleets of Vehicles with the Drivers and Co Drivers, Fuel, Tyre Pressure, GPS Tracking and Many More.
6. Smart Farming : Quality of Soil, Amount of Water Required, Suitable Crop for Type of Land
7. Hospitality : Electronic Key and Availability of Rooms.
8. Smart Grid and Energy Saving : Grid of Solar Panels, Amount of Energy it Generates, Maintenance

Data Science Process :
