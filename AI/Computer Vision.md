# Open Computer Vision

- How Computers See and Gain **High Level Understanding** from `Digital Images` or `Videos`.
- Works on Pattern Recognition.
- Understand and Automate the Task of Human Visual System.
- Detecting and `Image` | `Object`, Labeling them has Surpassed Humans.
- Faster than Human Reaction and 99% Accuracy.
- High Amount of Visual Data (Images and Videos) with Processing Capabilities.

### How Computer Sees an Image
- 0's and 1's
- Pixels are **Basic** | **Fundamental Unit** of Image 
- Multiple Pixels arranged in Matrix ( **Rows** and **Columns** ) forms an **Image**
- Each Pixels have `3 Channels` ( R [255,0,0] | G [0,255,0] | B [0,0,255] ) 8 Bits each.
- Number between 0 to 255 represents `Intensity` of Color.
- Binary : 0 or 1 ( `Single` Channel i.e 8 Bit )
- Black and White ( `Single` Channel | 8 Bits )
- Grayscale ( `Single` Channel | 8 Bits )
- RGB Color Image ( `3` Channels | `24` Bits | 8 Bits each Channel )

### Image Processing

- **Extract Infromation** from Image | Detailed Image Analysis.
- **Enhance** the Image | Change Color, Clearity, Size of Image.
- Images are converted `to` and `from` **NumPy** Array

> Black and White and Greyscale Images are **Different**
- Black and White is only Composed with either `Black` ( 000 ) or `White` ( fff )
- Grayscale is combination of different `Shades` of Black and White.

### **Binary** need `1 Bit Per Pixel` for Storage and **Black** and **White** needs `8 Bits Per Pixel` for **Storage**.
- Black and White will be **Dense** and shall render **Better Quality**.

### Applications 
1. `Autonomous` | 🚗 Self Driving Cars ( Detect Objects and Humans infront of Car, Reverse Parking )
2. Facial Recognition 👦🏻🧒🏻 ( Attendance, FB Friend Recognition )
3. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality 
4. Health Care ( X Ray and MRI Scan )
5. Video Motion Analysis ( Detect Face, Object in Video )
6. Image Segmentation ( Camera Detects the Multiple Faces in a Group Selfie )
7. Scene Reconstruction ( 3D Model Creation in Architecture )
8. Image Restoration ( Filtering Blur Images and Removing Noise )
9. Search By Image `Image.Google`
10. Robotics.
