# Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques

> Find Meaningful Structures and Patterns in the Observations

> Extract Important Features and Explore the Data Set in Detail.


### Clustering : 

> Automatically **Split** the Data Set into Groups According to Similarity. Good for Segmentation

> e.g. Determining Customer Segments in Marketing Data (Features : Gender, Location, Age, Education and Income)

### Anomaly Detection : 

> Automatically Discover Unusual Data Points in Data Set.

> Used to Find Fraudulent Transactions, Identify an Outlier caused by Human Error during Data Entry.

> Reduces Complexity of Data and Helps to Understand Data more Clearly and Better Way.

### Feature Selection :

> Understanding Each Feature before using it for Machine Learning.

> Sometimes Irrelevant Features Affects the Accuracy of Correct Model.

> Selecting Important Features helps to Improve Accuracy, Not Every Feature Adds Value to Solve Problem.


### Association Mining :

> Set of Items that Frequently Occur together in Data Set.

> Basket Analysis : Items Bought Together | Goods Purchased at the Same Time Help to Develop Marketing Strategies.

### Dimensionality Reduction :
> Reducing the Number of Features (Irrelevant)
