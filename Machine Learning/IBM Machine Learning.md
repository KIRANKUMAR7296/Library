# IBM Machine Learning

- Learn from Experience | Data 

- Improve Decision Making and Predictive Accuracy over Time..

### Algorithm 

- A Sequence of Statistical Processing Steps

- In Machine Learning Algorithms are Trained to Find Patterns and Features in Massive Amount of Data 

- Better the Algorithm, the more Accurate the Decisions and Predictions.


### Basic Steps in ML

1. Select and Prepare a Training Data Set 
- Training Data Set (Data from which the Model Learn)
- Training Data may be Labelled or Unlabelled (Extract Feature and Align Classification on it's own)
- Training Data should be Properly Prepared (Randomized | Check for Imbalance or Bias)
- Divide the Training Data Set into Train Subset (Train the Model) and Evaluation Subset (Test, Evaluate and Refine)

2. Choose Algorithm to run on Training Data Set 
- The Algorithm depends on Type of Data, Amount of Data and Type of Problem to be Solved.
### Labelled Data 
- Regression : Linear (Predict Value) and Logistic (Classification) 
- Understand Relationships between Data 
- SVM is useful when Dependent Variables are more difficult to Classify.
- Decision Tree | K Nearest Neighbor | KNN

### Unlabelled Data 
- Clustering : Identify Similar and form Segments | Clusters | Groups 
- K Mean 
- Association : Find Patterns and Relationships in Data | Data Mining

3. Training Algorithm to Create Model
- Training an Algorithm is an Iterative Process 
- Running Variables through Algorithms
- Comparing Outputs with Actual 
- Adjusting Weights and Biases (Coefficients)

4. Using and Improving Model
- Use Model with New Data 
- Improve Accuracy and Effectiveness of Model over Time.

### Supervised 
- Train itself on Labeled Data Set.
- Requires Less Training Data 
- Predicted Results can be Compared with the Actual Data 
- Danger of Overfitting  (Can Create a Model Biased to Training Data Set)

### Unsupervised 
- Unlabelled Data Set
- Identify Patterns and Relationships in Data that is missed by Human

### Semi Supervised 
- Between Supervised and Unsupervised 
- Small Labelled Data for Training + Learn the Pattern and Relationship

### Reinforcement
- A Behavioral Machine Learning Model
- Trial and Error
- Trained with Rules

### Real World Machine Learning

### 1. Digital Assistants
- Apple Siri | Amazon Alexa | Google Assistant
- Powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Enables Computer to Process Text and Voice Data 
- Understand and Talk with Human 
- Voice Driven Applications  (GPS | Speech to Text)

### 2. Recommendations
- Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra
- YouTube, Netflix, Prime, Spotify
- Retail, Travel, Hospitality, Job Search, News, Social Apps (Instagram | Twitter | Facebook)

### 3. Online Advertisements 
- Ad on the basis of User Interests

### 4. Chatbots
- Pattern Recognition + NLP + Deep Neural Networks
- Interpret Input Text and Provide Response

### 5. Fraud Detection
- Flagging Stolen Cards (Credit | Debit)

### 6. Cyber Security
- Extract Intelligence from Incident Report, Alerts, Blog Post
- Identify Potential Threats 
- Advise Security

### 7. Medical Image Analysis 
- Digital Medical Imaging
- CNN, RNN and other Deep Learning Models extracting Features and Information from Medical Images to Support Accurate Diagnoses.

### 8. Self Driving Cars 
- Continuous Object Identification in the Environment around the Car.
- Stop and Handle Speed of the Car by Calculating Distance.
