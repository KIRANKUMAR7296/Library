# IBM Machine Learning

- Learn from Experience | Data 

- Improve Decision Making and Predictive Accuracy over Time..

### Algorithm : A Sequence of Statistical Processing Steps

- In Machine Learning Algorithms are Trained to Find Patterns and Features in Massive Amount of Data 

- Better the Algorithm, the more Accurate the Decisions and Predictions.


### Basic Steps in ML

1. Select and Prepare a Training Data Set 
- Training Data Set (Data from which the Model Learn)
- Training Data may be Labelled or Unlabelled (Extract Feature and Align Classification on it's own)
- Training Data should be Properly Prepared (Randomized | Check for Imbalance or Bias)
- Divide the Training Data Set into Train Subset (Train the Model) and Evaluation Subset (Test, Evaluate and Refine)

2. Choose Algorithm to run on Training Data Set 
- The Algorithm depends on Type of Data, Amount of Data and Type of Problem to be Solved.
### Labelled Data 
- Regression : Linear (Predict Value) and Logistic (Classification) 
- Understand Relationships between Data 
- SVM is useful when Dependent Variables are more difficult to Classify.
- Decision Tree | K Nearest Neighbor | KNN

### Unlabelled Data 
- Clustering : Identify Similar and form Segments | Clusters | Groups 
- K Mean 
- Association : Find Patterns and Relationships in Data | Data Mining

3. Training Algorithm to Create Model
- Training an Algorithm is an Iterative Process 
- Running Variables through Algorithms
- Comparing Outputs with Actual 
- Adjusting Weights and Biases (Coefficients)

4. Using and Improving Model
- Use Model with New Data 
- Improve Accuracy and Effectiveness of Model over Time.
