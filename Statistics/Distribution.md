# Types of **Distribution**.

#### Discrete Events.

- **Finite** number of outcomes : Die | Picking a Card : 

1. Uniform Distribution
- **X ~ U ( 3 , 7 )**
- Variable **X** follows an **Uniform Distribution** ranging from 3 to 7.
- Events with **Finite** outcomes. 
- All the outcomes have Equal | **Same** Probability. 
- Flip a Coin ( H | T )
- Roll a Dice ( 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 )

2. Bernoulli Distribution
- **X ~ Bern ( p )**
- Variable **X** follows a **Bernoulli Distribution** with **p** ( probability | likelihood ) of success. 
- Event with only 1 Trial and 2 Possible Outcomes ( True or False | Yes or No | 1 or 0 ) 
- We know the **Probability** of Outcome.
- If probability of one outcome is **p**(1) the probability of an other outcome is **1 - p**(0).
- E ( X ) = p or ( 1 - p ) ( **Expected Probability** of X ) | p > 1 - p
- Variance : p ( 1 - p )
- A Coin flip | A Single True or False Question | Vote between 2 Parties.

3. Binomial Distribution
- **X ~ B ( n , p )**
- Variable **X** follows a **Binomial Distribution** with **n** trials and **p** (probability | likelihood) of success in each **Individual Trial**.
- **Sequence** | **Trials** of **Identical Bernoulli Events**.
- Flipping a Coin **Twice** | Rolling two Dies | Quiz of 10 True or False Questions.



- Event with Frequency of Occurence (May happen or not) follows **Poisson Distribution** (Number of **Goals** in Football or Number of **Baskets** in Basketball).

B. **Poissson** Distrbution
- Number of **Occurences**.
- The Frequency with which an Event occurs within a specific interval. 
- e.g. a Fire Fly lights up 3 times in 10 Seconds.


### Continuous Events.

- **Infiinite** number of outcomes : Time | Distance : 

- Events Normal in Nature. (Average Height of Person) follows **Normal Distribution**.
- Events Normal in Nature but limited Sample follows **T Distribution**.
- **Chi Squared Distribution** : Asymmetric Distribution Starts from 0 and only positive : Measure Goodness of Fit
- Rapid changing Event follows **Exponential Distribution**.
- Forecast and Prediction Events follows **Logistic Distribution**. (Which Team will Win, Weather Forecast)



A. **Normal** Distribution | **Gaussian** Distribution | **Bell Shaped Curve** 
- Mean = 0 and Standard Deviation = 1
