# Density Curve

> **Density Curve** helps us to **Visualize** the overall shape of a distribution. 

- We use **Histogram** to represent **Frequency Distribution** of Data ( Number of Data Points in given **Intervals** )
- **Regular Frequency Distribution** can be converted into **Relative Frequency Distribution** ( **Proportion** | **Percentage** )
- Relative Frequency Distribution : **Divide** Each Interval **Data Points** with **Total** Number of Data Points in a Dataset.

> Density Curve gives a better Picture about how the Dataset is distributed.
