> Describing **Distributions** using **Numbers**

### Measures of Centre | Central Tendency

### 1. Mean 
- Arithmetic average of Data Points.

### 2. Median : 
- The Data Value that is in the **Middle** of an **Ordered** Dataset.
- If Dataset is very large the posistion of **Median** : (n + 1) / 2

### 3. Mode 
- Most Frequently observed Data Value | Data Point.

### Measures of Spread

### 1. Range
- Max - Min

### 2. Standard Deviation (**S**)
- How close the **Data Values** in the Dataset are to the **Mean**
- **Small** Standard Deviation means low **Variability** | Most of the Data points are close to **Mean**
- **Large** Standard Deviation means high **Variability** | Most of the Data points are far away from the **Mean**

### 3. Variance (**S**<sup>2</sup>)
