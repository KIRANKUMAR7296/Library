# Statistics


> Describing **Distributions** using **Numbers**

### Measures of Centre | Central Tendency

1. **Mean** 
- Arithmetic average of Data Points.

2. **Median**  
- The Data Value that is in the **Middle** of an **Ordered** Dataset.
- If Dataset is very large the posistion of **Median** : `( n + 1 ) / 2`

3. **Mode** 
- Most Frequently observed **Data Value** | **Data Point**.

### Measures of Spread

1. **Range**
- Max - Min

2. **Standard Deviation** (**S**)
- How close the **Data Values** in the Dataset are to the **Mean**
- **Small** Standard Deviation means low **Variability** | Most of the Data points are close to **Mean**
- **Large** Standard Deviation means high **Variability** | Most of the Data points are far away from the **Mean**

3. **Variance** (**S**<sup>2</sup>)

> The **Effect** of **Transforming** Data on **Spread** and **Centre**

- Measures of **Centre** are Affected by every **Mathematical Operations** (+ - * /)
- Measures of **Spread** are only Affected by **Multiplication & Divison** (* and /)

> The **Effect** of **Outliers** on **Spread** and **Centre**

-  A Data Value that is numerically **Distant** from a Dataset.

1. Effect on **Mean**
-  Heavily affected

2. Effect on **Median**
-  **Low** or **No** affect on the **Median**
-  Median only cares about **Centre**.

3. Effect on **Mode**
-  **No** affect on the **Mode** 
-  Mode only cares about **Most Frequent** Data Value.

4. Effect on **Range**
-  **Heavily** affects the **Range** ( Outlier can be very High ( **Max** ) or Low ( **Min** ) value )

6. Effect on **Standard Deviation**
-  **Heavily** affected because **Mean** is considered while Calculating **Standard Deviation**.
