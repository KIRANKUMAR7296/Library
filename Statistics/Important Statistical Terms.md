# Statistical Concepts you should know for Data Science

### 1. P Values

- **Probability** of **Achieving** a result.
- if p value < alpha (0.05 | 5%) we remove that feature.
- if p value > alpha (0.05 | 5%) we keep that feature.

### 2. Z Test

- A **Hypothesis Test** with a **Normal Distribution** that uses a **Z Statistics**.
- We use **Z Test** when we have **Large Sample Size**.

### 3. T Test

- A **Hypothesis Test** with a **T Distribution** that uses a **T Statistics**.
- We use **T Test** when we have **Small Sample Size**.

### 4. Linear Regression and Assumptions

- Model **Relationship** between a **Dependent Variable** and one or nore **Independent Variable**
- Finding the Line of **Best Fit** that represents two or more variables.
- Line of Best Fit is found by minimizing the **Sum of Squared Residuals**
- Residuals : **Predicted** - **Actual**

Assumptions

1. **Linearity** : The Relationship between **X** and **Mean** of **Y** is linear.
2. **Homoscedasticity** : The **Variance** of the **Residual** is the same for any value of **X**.
3. **Independence** : **Observations** are **Independent** of each other.
4. **Normality** : For any value of **X**, **Y** is normally distributed.
