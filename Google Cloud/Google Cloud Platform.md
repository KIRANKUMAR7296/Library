### Why Cloud Computing ?

Before **Cloud Computing** to Host a **Website** or **Application** on a Server company needed to setup an **Infrastructure** (Servers) and **Manpower** (Developer, System Engineers, etc) for management.

### Problems :
1. Invest Heavily for **Setup** and **Resources**.
2. Monitoring **Scalability** and **Flexibilty**.
3. Less Time to Focus on Business.
4. Data **Security** Risks.
5. Data **Storage** Risks.
6. **Maintenance** Cost. 
7. Lack of Planning.

### How Cloud Computing Helps ?

- Cloud Computing is like our Electricity, Water and Gas Supply.
- **Pay** only for How much you use (Optimum)
- No Waste of **Resource**, **Energy** and **Money**.
- **Security**, **Infrastructure**, **Maintenance** and **Planning** everything is managed by the Service Provider.
- Helps us to only **Focus** on our Business.
- Access from across the **Globe** 24 x 7 

### Cloud Service Providers 

- `Amazon` : `AWS` | Amazon Web Services | Leading Cloud Service Provider.
- `IBM` : IBM Cloud
- `Microsoft` : `Azure` | Well Integrated with Microsoft Family | Best for Hybrid Computing.
- `Google` : `GCP` Google Cloud Platform | Fairly Integrated with Google Products | Latest and Best Optimized Pricing. 

`Google` is growing very fast towards market. `Cheaper` than all others.

### What is Google Cloud Platform ?

- On demand Cloud Service Provider like `Compute`, `Storage` and `Network`.
- It can be accessed throught the Internet across the `Globe`. 
- User is not required to Manage the `Resource` and `Infrastructure`.
- User will just `Focus` on Business.
- Provides `Virtual Machines`, `Storage`, `Security`, `Scalability` and `Flexibility`.

### How they Provide Fast Service ?

- Data is stored at Data Centers which is present in Multiple Regions.
- e.g. In India consider Data Centers are present in `Mumbai`, `Delhi`, `Kolkata`, `Bangalore` and `Hyderabad`.
- So User uses the Services from the Region closer to him.
- If any of the Server fails he will get the Service from another region.
- There will be very low to No `Latency` if the Service is offered from another Region Server.
