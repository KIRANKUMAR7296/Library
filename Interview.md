1. Balancing **Bias** and **Variance**
- We try to make out **Model** more **Accurate** by **Tuning** and **Tweaking** the **Parameters**.
- But we cannot make a **100%** Accurate Model.
- **Prediction** and **Classification** Models, can never be **Error Free**.

> Y = f ( **x** ) + **e**

**Y** : Response Variable | Dependent Variable
**x** : Independent Variable
**e** : Irreducible Error

- Even we make a **100%** Accurate Estimate of **f(x)**, Our Model won't be **Error Free**, known as **Irreducible Error**
